Project Title
Prodigy Infotech Cyber Security Internship Tasks

Project Overview
This repository contains the tasks completed during my Cyber Security Internship at Prodigy Infotech. The work focuses on practical security concepts implemented using Python. Each task targets a core area of cyber security and emphasizes ethical learning and real-world application.

Internship Tasks

Task 01. Caesar Cipher
Built a Python program to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher technique. The tool accepts user input and shift values to perform secure text transformation. This task covers cryptography basics and string handling.

Task 02. Image Encryption Using Pixel Manipulation
Developed a simple image encryption tool by modifying pixel values through mathematical operations. The program supports encryption and decryption of images, demonstrating how visual data can be protected.

Task 03. Password Complexity Checker
Created a password strength checker that evaluates passwords based on length, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The tool provides clear feedback to help users create stronger passwords.

Task 04. Simple Keylogger
Implemented a basic keylogger that records keystrokes and saves them to a file. This task was completed strictly for educational purposes, with strong emphasis on ethics, permissions, and responsible use.

Task 05. Network Packet Analyzer
Developed a packet analyzer to capture and inspect network packets. The tool displays source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data to help understand network traffic behavior.
